# Porto Landmarks

In this project was developed image recognition and object detection of Porto's landmarks.

A set of images and annotation of all these landmarks was given, which was used to create a system that can label and identify which images contain these landmarks.

To achieve this, a deep learning solution using TensorFlow and Google Collaboratory was developed, so that any user can use it independently of their hardware.
